My R scripts and codes for my publications

These are all the R scripts and codes I have used for my recent publications. They are all open, unless otherwise explained. 
You can download them and use for yourself. My main objective here is to turn my data analysis reproducible for a wider
audience. 
Feel free to contact me if you need further assistence on this.
